# PGM_Project_23

This project is an exploration and experimentation with Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs). The main goal is to propose modifications to the standard VAE and evaluate the impact of these changes. 

## Project Description

The project starts with a basic implementation of a VAE. From there, we experiment with various modifications. Any improvement, whether it's already existing in the literature or an original proposal, is of interest. In case of using existing modifications, appropriate references will be provided.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Please feel free to experiment with the VAE and propose your modifications.

## References

The basic implementation of the VAE is inspired by the tutorial: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/cvae
