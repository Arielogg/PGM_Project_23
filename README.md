# PGM Project 2023 - Variational Autoencoders for Surface Engineering

## Introduction
Welcome to our project on exploring and experimenting with Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)! Our aim is to delve into the standard VAE architecture and propose modifications to evaluate their impacts in the realm of surface engineering.

## Project Description

We begin with a foundational implementation of a VAE, setting the stage for a series of experiments. Our journey involves:

- **Experimenting with Modifications**: We're not just tinkering with existing modifications - we're also keen on introducing our own. Our goal is to push the boundaries of what VAEs can achieve.
- **Literature-Backed Improvements**: Where we stand on the shoulders of giants, we make sure to give credit. All existing modifications are duly referenced in our project report, soon publicly available.
  
## Getting Started

To dive into our project, here's a quick guide:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install necessary packages.
3. **Explore the Notebooks**: We've documented our experiments and findings in Jupyter Notebooks, which are a great way to see our work in action.
